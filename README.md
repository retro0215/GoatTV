OwnTV is a native **Android TV** IPTV **player** built with Kotlin, Jetpack Compose for TV, and a
**dual playback engine** — **libmpv (FFmpeg)** for movies/series and maximum compatibility, **ExoPlayer
(Media3)** for near-instant Live TV. It's a *player only* — you bring your own Xtream login, M3U playlist
(by **URL or a local `.m3u`/`.m3u8` file** on the device), or **Stalker/Ministra portal (Portal URL + MAC,
with optional Serial Number, Device IDs, and Signature)**, and OwnTV gives you a fast, modern,
remote-first way to browse and watch them.

> ⚠️ OwnTV does **not** provide any channels, playlists, subscriptions, streams, or media content.
> You are responsible for adding your own legally accessible sources.

This is an **open-source** project — the code is original (not derived from any other app) and was
**built with the help of AI**. **Contributions are welcome**: clone, build, and test it freely. It
targets **Android TV only** (leanback launcher, D-pad-first UI).

> ### 📖 New here? Read the [**User Guide & Hidden Features →**](extras/USER_GUIDE.md)
> Long‑press to favourite, **Left** for the channel list (**Left** again to browse categories) and
> **Right** for recently watched, the
> MPV/EXO toggle's **compatibility mode**,
> catch‑up from the Guide, startup landing, A/V‑sync — all the remote shortcuts in one place.

## ✨ Features

### 🎬 Playback
- **Dual engine** — libmpv (FFmpeg) for max compatibility + ExoPlayer for instant Live TV; per-channel toggle and automatic VOD fallback between them
- Zero-copy **4K HDR** direct rendering · opt-in **auto frame rate** (off by default; 24/25/50/60 fps display matching, with the rate measured when a live stream doesn't declare one) · **live buffering you control** (Live latency drives the real buffer, plus a Pre-buffer gate that can be set per playlist) · context-aware channel zapping (D-pad/CH± stays in Favorites, History, All or the opened category) · **self-correcting surround sound** (Auto/Stereo only/Surround, with an audio-output watchdog that falls back to stereo if your TV or soundbar can't actually play it) + 150% volume boost
- **Subtitles** — text (SRT/ASS), image (PGS/VOBSUB/DVB), closed captions, preferred-language auto-selection and independent font/style controls, plus OpenSubtitles search and local files; dedicated OpenSubtitles settings sign in on one panel — username, password and optional API key/Worker together — filled in on the TV or handed over from another device by QR + PIN
- Resume prompts, next-episode auto-play, mini-player/PiP, **audio-only mode**, confirmed radio/audio-only item labelling, and a live codec/resolution/HDR stream-info overlay
- **Behaves like a TV app** — remote/headset/assistant transport keys via a system media session, and audio focus that ducks for a notification instead of pausing your film
- **Diagnostics you can send** — a playback log of failures *and* events, "Report this stream" from the info overlay, optional detailed trace, and a one-press export to `Download/owntv-playback-report.txt`

### 🧭 Browse
- **Continue Watching** home with TMDB-enriched previews; Live / Movies / Series / Downloads / Guide sections
- **Now Trending** Home showcase — current TMDB movie/series rankings matched to titles your active provider
  can actually play, with trailers, full cast/details, provider language/quality/season signals, and flexible
  movie/series balancing; a dedicated Home setting turns it on/off, and it stays first when enabled
- Per-profile customizable rows, Favorites & History, bulk rename rules, custom combined categories,
  inline + global search, and a multi-playlist switcher
- Per-section panel widths for Live TV, Movies and Series, including a 0% option that completely hides
  the preview/poster panel while keeping the remaining panels at an exact 100% total
- **Episode grid** — browse a show by episode stills instead of text rows, with a show-artwork and
  episode-number fallback for episodes TMDB can't match; a whole show's episode details arrive in a
  single request
- **TMDB** posters, plots, cast photos & trailers **in 40 languages**; scales to ~50k channels / ~168k movies with priority + incremental syncing
- Dedicated **Metadata** settings show minute/hour/day shared allowance and support a personal TMDB key or self-hosted Worker, including remote hand-over over LAN (QR + PIN)
- Bring your own **free TMDB key** for unlimited metadata — send it from another device (phone, tablet or PC) over LAN (QR + PIN) instead of typing 32 characters with the remote; the built-in shared service works with no setup and gives every device a fair daily share

### 📥 Sources & EPG
- App-wide **custom DNS** — System, Google, Cloudflare, Quad9, custom DNS or DNS-over-HTTPS; the selected resolver persists across restarts
- **Xtream**, **M3U** (typed playlists), and **Stalker/Ministra** portals, including optional advanced device identification; add any source from another device (phone, tablet or PC) over LAN (QR + PIN) — including uploading an `.m3u` file straight from the computer
- XMLTV **TV Guide** grid, **Catch-up TV** (up to 7 days) + live rewind, auto EPG matching, multiple guide sources
- **Catch-up works without a guide** — a **Catch-up** category listing every channel with an archive, plus **Go back to…** to jump to a time (or an exact day/hour/minute) instead of holding rewind
- **Clock in every player**, and while replaying a recording a second one showing when the programme originally aired, with a matching **Playing / Then** guide row
- **Guide time offset** — correct a guide published in another time zone, globally or per channel
- Optional **guide channel logos** — per EPG source, use that feed's own logos instead of your playlist's
- M3U extras honoured: per-item HTTP headers on live, movie and series entries (`#EXTVLCOPT` / `#EXTHTTP` / `#KODIPROP` / URL suffix) and the `append` / `shift` / `flussonic` / `xc` catch-up styles
- **Protected (DRM) channels** — Widevine and ClearKey over DASH/HLS, read from the playlist's `#KODIPROP` licence properties; uses the CDM built into the device, so there is nothing to configure and no licence to buy

### 👥 Profiles & Downloads
- Multiple profiles with own favorites/history/resume, PIN locks, and a "Who's watching?" gate; Kids mode hides adult provider folders/items and TMDB adult results throughout browsing, Guide and playback, while normal profiles keep the full catalogue
- Per-profile startup can open Home, resume last channel, enter Live Favorites, or immediately play a chosen Live channel selected with a searchable TV-friendly picker; profile selection and PIN locks are always respected
- Offline movies & episodes — pause/resume/retry, queue groups + storage bar, live poster status strip

### 🎨 Settings & Robustness
- Material 3 theming & accent, a user-chosen **Focus highlight** (colour via presets/palette/hex plus
  four ring thicknesses, applied app-wide in both solid and glass materials), unified browse panels,
  compact navigation, optional solid-mode Ambient Glow,
  and interaction-aware **Glass Effect** with Ultra Clear/Clear/Balanced/Tinted/Opaque/Custom presets,
  adaptive readability and real frost levels over your own background photo; searchable settings,
  sidebar/category customization, adjustable panel widths, external player, weather chip
- **Font customization** with 60%–140% app text sizing and separate main-interface/popup choices from the bundled font catalog plus system Monospace; settings are preserved in backup and restore, while subtitle font and styling remain independently configurable
- **24 complete interface languages** with System default, an in-app searchable language picker, RTL-aware navigation, and a language-first welcome flow on fresh installations
- **Backup & Restore** locally or over Wi-Fi — a single `.own` file carrying your background image and your downloaded subtitles, optionally encrypted end to end with your own password (older `.json` backups still restore). Android's automatic backup is deliberately disabled, so app data only ever leaves the device through this screen — secrets ride only when you set a backup password. Plus in-app updates; memory-safe buffers, no-ANR threading, auto-reconnect, resilient imports & offline detection

## 🧱 Tech stack

| Area | Choice |
|------|--------|
| Language | Kotlin 2.3.21 (no `kotlin-android` plugin) |
| Build | AGP 9.3.1 / Gradle 9.7.0, KSP2 2.3.11 |
| UI | Jetpack Compose for TV (`androidx.tv:tv-material` 1.1.0), Compose BOM 2026.06.01 |
| Media | **libmpv** (FFmpeg) — `dev.jdtech.mpv:libmpv` · **ExoPlayer/Media3** 1.11.0 (Live TV + image subs) |
| Database | Room 2.8.4 + Paging 3.5.0 + FTS4 (WAL) |
| DI | Koin 4.1.1 |
| Networking | OkHttp 5 (`okhttp-android`) |
| Images | Coil 3.3.0 |
| Preferences | DataStore |

`minSdk 26`, `targetSdk 36`, `applicationId tv.own.owntv`.

> **Build note:** there is no `kotlin-android` plugin. AGP 9 ships its own Kotlin, but the Compose
> compiler plugin pulls the Kotlin Gradle plugin up to the `kotlin` version pinned in
> `gradle/libs.versions.toml` — that is what actually compiles the app, so keep the Compose compiler
> plugin on exactly that version. KSP must track the same Kotlin line for Room codegen to work.

## ⚙️ How it works (backend)

- **Parsing & sync** — M3U playlists are line-streamed and Xtream `player_api` JSON is read with
  `android.util.JsonReader`, so huge provider payloads are never fully buffered. `SyncManager` does a
  clear-then-insert refresh in ~500-row chunked transactions with Flow progress and cancellation.
- **Storage** — a 27-entity Room schema: profiles & sources (`ProfileSourceCrossRef` for sharing),
  content (categories/channels/movies/series/seasons/episodes), per-profile favorites/history/progress/
  downloads, EPG channels/programmes, external-subtitle cache/selection/timing/links, and FTS4 search
  tables. Totals come from indexed `COUNT` queries.
- **Lists** — Paging 3 with a bounded `maxSize` keeps memory flat across 50k+ item lists.
- **EPG** — bulk XMLTV is stream-parsed (gzip-aware) into a rolling now→+48h window and pruned.
- **Player** — two engines behind a small `PlaybackEngine` interface: **libmpv** (movies/series, and any
  live stream ExoPlayer can't open) and **ExoPlayer/Media3** (Live TV — instant HLS). Live "promotes" the
  running preview straight to full-screen (no reload); the shell hoists the active surface across full ↔
  mini-player. Player state is published as `StateFlow`s for the Compose HUD.
- **DI** — Koin modules (`appModule`, `databaseModule`, `dataModule`, `playerModule`).

## 📥 Installing (Fire TV / Android TV)

Grab the signed APK from the [**latest release**](https://github.com/ahXN00/OwnTV/releases/latest) and
sideload it. A fixed link always points at the newest signed build:

```
https://github.com/ahXN00/OwnTV/releases/latest/download/OwnTV.apk
```

- **Fire TV** — install the **Downloader** app (by AFTVnews) from the Amazon Appstore, then enter the
  **Downloader code `4308278`** (or [`aftv.news/4308278`](https://aftv.news/4308278), which always
  points at the latest signed `OwnTV.apk`). Enable *Apps from Unknown Sources* if prompted.
- **Android TV / Google TV** — the **Downloader** app is also on Google Play, so the same code
  **`4308278`** works here too. (If Downloader doesn't show in search, open the Play Store on the TV —
  you can reach it via *Settings → Apps → See all apps → Show system apps → Google Play Store* — and
  install it from there.) Or just sideload the APK with your tool of choice (*Send files to TV*, a USB
  drive, or `adb install OwnTV.apk`).

> Only install the APK from this repository's official Releases (or the `…/releases/latest/download/OwnTV.apk`
> link above). It's the build signed by this project's CI — third-party re-hosts aren't endorsed.
>
> Releases ship **two APKs**: `OwnTV-vX.X.X.apk` / `OwnTV.apk` (arm: `arm64-v8a` + `armeabi-v7a` — for
> all real Fire TV / Android TV devices, and what the Downloader code fetches), and
> `OwnTV-x86_64-vX.X.X.apk` (for emulators / rare Intel boxes). Real devices always want the arm build.

## 🛠️ Building & running

> Only needed if you want to build from source. Most people can just **[install the ready-made APK](#-installing-fire-tv--android-tv)** instead — no build tools required.

**What you need first**
- **[Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)** (a recent version that supports AGP 9.x) — this bundles the JDK and Android SDK, so you don't install those separately.
- A build target: either a real **Android TV / Fire TV** device (with USB or wireless debugging turned on), or an **Android TV emulator** created from Android Studio's Device Manager.

**Steps**
1. **Get the code** — click the green **Code** button on GitHub → *Download ZIP* (and unzip it), or run `git clone https://github.com/ahXN00/OwnTV.git`.
2. **Open it** — in Android Studio choose **Open**, pick the project folder, and wait for the first **Gradle sync** to finish (it downloads dependencies; give it a few minutes the first time).
3. **Pick the right build variant** — open **Build Variants** (left sidebar) and choose the flavor that matches your target:
   - **`standard`** — real TV/phone/Fire TV devices and arm emulators (`arm64-v8a` + `armeabi-v7a`)
   - **`x86_64`** — x86_64 emulators only
   - This matters: the native libmpv player only loads on a matching ABI, so the wrong choice = no playback.
4. **Press Run** (▶) with your device/emulator selected. The app installs and launches. It shows up in the **TV launcher** on Android TV, and as a normal app icon on phones/tablets too (minimum **Android 8.0 / API 26**).

**Prefer the command line?** From the project folder run `./gradlew assembleDebug` (use `gradlew.bat assembleDebug` on Windows). The APK lands in `app/build/outputs/apk/`.

**First launch** — choose the app language (or keep **System default**) before pressing **Get Started**. The modern four-page onboarding then takes you through the disclaimer, profile/backup choice, and adding a source (M3U, Xtream, or Stalker/MAC portal). You can also restore a local backup or send one from another device. Change the interface language later under **Settings → Look & Feel → Language**; this is separate from the TMDB metadata-language setting. After a source imports, browse from the sidebar and open the **Guide** for the EPG.

**Tested on:** a real **TCL Google TV**, and the **Android Studio emulator** (both the Android TV and Google TV system images).

### ▶️ Playback engines

- **[mpv](https://mpv.io/)** (via [libmpv](https://github.com/mpv-android/mpv-android), built on
  [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/)) — the default engine, for the widest IPTV/codec, audio and HDR support.
- **[Media3 / ExoPlayer](https://github.com/androidx/media)** — the fast-start engine for Live TV
  preview and HLS.

Which of the two starts a stream is yours to set, separately for Live TV and for Movies & Series
(Settings → Video Player): either order, or one engine only with the automatic handover turned off.
