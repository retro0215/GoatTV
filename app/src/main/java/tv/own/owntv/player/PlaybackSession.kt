/**
 * The app's single point of contact with the rest of the system's audio: **audio focus** and a
 * **MediaSession** (F27). Before this, OwnTV neither requested focus nor published a session, so two
 * apps could play over each other and the TV's transport keys / Assistant "pause" never reached the
 * player.
 *
 * It is engine-agnostic on purpose. OwnTV plays through mpv *and* two ExoPlayer engines, and which one
 * owns the speaker changes with the content; all three already implement [PlaybackEngine], so this class
 * only ever talks to that interface. `OwnTVShell` is the one place that knows which engine is live, so it
 * [attach]es it and passes `null` when the player closes.
 *
 * ### Focus policy: duck, don't pause
 * A TV is not a phone. A navigation prompt, a doorbell camera notification or an Assistant reply must not
 * stop a live channel — a paused live stream falls behind the edge and comes back either late or as a
 * fresh reconnect, and a paused film loses the moment being watched. So:
 *
 * | Focus change | What we do |
 * |---|---|
 * | `LOSS_TRANSIENT_CAN_DUCK` | nothing — `setWillPauseWhenDucked(false)` means the platform attenuates our stream itself, with no HUD-visible volume change |
 * | `LOSS_TRANSIENT` | duck to [DUCK_PERCENT] ourselves and restore on the next gain |
 * | `LOSS` (permanent) | **pause**, and abandon focus. This one is another app taking the speaker for good; continuing is the "two apps playing at once" bug |
 * | `GAIN` | restore the pre-duck volume; playback that we paused stays paused (the user chose the other app) |
